# Stroh's formalism and critical stress intensity factor for brittle behaviour of crack under mode-I loading (Griffith's model)

The file converts anisotropic elastic constants to compliance constants. The file "Compute_Kig_using_Stroh_formalism.py" computes the Griffith's fracture toughness. The Stroh's formalism is provided in the article "Atomistic modeling of fracture" by P Andric and W A Curtin
